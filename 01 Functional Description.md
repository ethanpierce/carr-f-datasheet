Functional Description
----------------------

Notecarriers are designed to bridge the gap between prototype and production
for the Notecard. The Notecard is designed to be socketed directly onto the
circuit board using an edge connector socket, along with a customer's MCU,
sensors, and controls. While such a model provides a highly modular
configuration for the final product, it can make prototyping unnecessarily
difficult.

Notecarriers offer breakout connections for the Notecard, as well as circuitry
to provide power management, protection and signal amplification.

### Features

- **Simple.** Provides breadboard compatible pins or solderable mask for direct
connections.
- **Compatible.** Level shifters ensure compatibility with 3.3V or 5V equipment.
- **Convenient.** Powered by a micro-USB connector (requires 2A supply). I2C connections via JST-SH connectors. power inputs via JST-PH connectors.
- **GPS Ready.** Models are either active GPS compatible, or feature a built-in
antenna to enable GPRS connectivity.
- **Outboard DFU support. **Support updating the onboard firmware of the blues swan or other compatible feathers over the cellular or wifi connection of the notecard.
